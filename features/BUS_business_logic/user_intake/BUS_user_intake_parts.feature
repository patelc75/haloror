Feature: User intake parts
  In order to make sure user intake works completely
  As a user
  I want all individual sections and parts of user intake tested

  Scenario: Test mode checkboxes put senior in test mode, not member of safety_care
  Scenario: Test mode checkboxes put all caregivers away
  Scenario: "Test Mode" checkbox should be checked by default
  Scenario: Billing date shows as "Desired" billing date
  Scenario: Verify Bill Monthly is checked in the user intake form, then Credit Card column is blank
  Scenario: Validation: "Desired Installation Date" must be 48 hours after submitted_at
  Scenario: "Desired Installation Date" should auto-fill to order date + 7.days for direct_to_consumer group
