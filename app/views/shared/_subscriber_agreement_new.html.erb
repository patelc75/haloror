        Grant</u>.  Subscriber hereby
        grants Halo and Provider a license to access and use the Health Data in connection
        with the services provided by Halo or Provider.  The Subscriber also grants Halo the right to access, utilize,
        create and publish derivative works from any and all Health Data.  The derivative works may use Health Data
        for creating statistics of a larger population.  When doing so, Halo does
        not include any personal identifying information; nor will the Provider be
        identified.  For example, Halo
        might publish fall statistics or the number of hours the Equipment is worn
        during sleep for the entire User population.
        <br/><b >2.3        </b><u>Authorization</u>. The
        Subscriber hereby authorizes Halo and Provider to share the Health Data, only with
        entities and individuals for the purpose of providing emergency care and for the purpose of sharing information with
        others selected by the Subscriber.  The Subscriber agrees that this authorization permits the
        disclosure of health or treatment information to Caregivers and Emergency
        Personnel that may also contain sensitive health information.
        <br/>This
        authorization will remain in effect and permit the ongoing disclosure by Halo or
        Provider of the Health Data until the Subscriber cancels the monitoring services or
        revokes the authorization by notifying Halo in writing. The Subscriber agrees
        that any revocation will not apply to actions Halo or
        Provider have already taken in reliance on prior authorization.
        <p ><b
        >2.4        </b><u>User Intake Form</u>. The
        Subscriber shall use the User Intake
        Form to designate the identity of the User's Caregivers and place any limitations on the use of Health Data.  The Subscriber is responsible for the accuracy and
        completeness of the information provided to Halo using the User Intake Form.  If
        the Internet Portal is used to input
        the information supplied on the User Intake Form, the Subscriber is responsible for the security of his or her
        passwords and for any use of the Subscriber's account.  The Subscriber is at
        least 18 years of age.  The Subscriber's use of the Internet
        Portal and Equipment shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and
        ordinances, including any laws relating to the export of data or software.  The
        Subscriber shall not disrupt the proper operation of the Equipment or the

        or display. The Subscriber acknowledges that Halo is not a "covered entity"
        under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations
        promulgated thereunder ("<b >HIPAA</b>").  As
        a result, HIPAA does not apply to the transmission of Health Data by Halo to
        any third party.
        <p ><b
        >2.6        </b><u>Telephone provider</u>. The
        Subscriber acknowledges that if the User's
        telephone line is occupied, the Equipment will not be able to obtain access to
        the phone line unless the User has
        his or her telephone provider install a RJ31X jack for connecting the myHalo
        Equipment.  If the User has such jack installed, the Subscriber consents to an
        interrupt of the User's
        telephone in the event the Equipment detects an emergency or life-threatening
        situation. 
        <p ><b
        >2.7        Equipment
        Operation and </b><u>Reporting Problems</u>.  The Subscriber, User or their designated Caregiver is
        responsible for determining that the Equipment and supporting Internet and/or
        phone line continue to work properly by monitoring the status LEDs on the
        Equipment (Gateway) and/or viewing the User's on line web portal display and
        event reports.  The Subscriber
        shall report to Halo or Provider, as soon as practical, any perceived defect in
        the Equipment or Internet Portal.  The Subscriber shall provide to Halo
        an evaluation of the Equipment, Internet Portal, and services provided by Halo
        upon Halo's reasonable request.  
        <p >2.8        Caregiver(s)
        alerts are provided as setup in the Caregiver profile(s); however, the
        Caregiver alerts are not intended as a substitute for the myHalo call center
        and emergency responders for a User fall detected emergency. 
        <p ><b
        >2.9        </b><u>Use of Panic
        Button</u>. The Subscriber agrees that the Equipment's panic button should
        be used only in the event of an emergency.  The Subscriber
        acknowledges that Caregivers and Emergency Personnel will be notified, even if
        the panic button was activated accidentally or in error; and the alarm is not
        reset by pushing the red reset button on the front of the myHalo Gateway within
        two minutes to clear the alarm, or if the User or a Caregiver is not able to
        speak to the Call Center when they call to respond to the alarm.
        <p > 
        <p ><b ><u>3.  HALO'S RIGHTS AND
        OBLIGATIONS</u></b>
        <p ><b
        >3.1        </b><u>Relay of
        Health Data</u>.  Halo shall use its reasonable best
        efforts to contact Emergency Personnel and Caregivers in the event the
        Equipment detects an emergency situation or receives notice that the
        Equipment's panic button has been activated.  Halo will transmit
        pertinent Health Data to the Caregivers and Emergency Personnel, in accordance
        with the account settings in the User's
        Health Data file as established by the Subscriber or User.

        <p ><b> </b>
        <br/><b >This form must be completed when the Subscriber
        Agreement is signed or at installation if Halo or their representative do the
        installation for the User. </b>By signing below I acknowledge the following: <b
        >Account Activation.</b> You must first fill
        out and submit the User Intake Form at least 48 hours before attempting
        installation.  Also, any subsequent
        profile updates for the User and/or Caregiver may also take 24 to 48 hours to
        update and change how and who the call center contacts for critical events.
        <br/>&#186;       <b
        >Quick Start and User Guide.</b>  I have received and read the myHalo Personal
        Monitoring and Alert System User Guide.
        <br/>&#186;       <b
        >RJ31X Jack.  </b>If the User's standard
        telephone line is occupied, the Equipment will not be able to obtain access to
        the phone line unless the Subscriber has his or her telephone provider install
        a RJ31X jack for connecting the myHalo Equipment to the phone line.  If the Subscriber has such jack
        installed, the Equipment will interrupt the User's telephone in the event it
        detects an emergency or life-threatening situation.  This is necessary to ensure the call center receives
        notification of the event.  Contact
        a professional phone line installer for further details. If you have a home
        alarm system connected to the phone line, the installer will need to coordinate
        with the alarm system company to ensure that your home alarm service is not
        disabled or disrupted.
        <br/>&#186;       <b
        >Uninterruptible Power Supply.</b>  The Subscriber may wish to use an
        optional UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) in conjunction with the myHalo Equipment.  Doing so will provide battery backup
        power for the myHalo Home Gateway for a limited time during an AC power failure
        and can allow continued communication between the Home Gateway and the standard
        phone line during the power outage. 
        Refer to UPS manufacturer's installation instructions.
        <br/>&#186;       <b
        >Surge Protector.</b>  If
        the Subscriber elects not to use a UPS as described above, it is advised the
        Subscriber install a UL rated surge protector to protect both the power
        connection and any phone line connections to the Equipment.  In the event of a power surge or line
        spike, the Equipment may be damaged and prevent its operation.  YOUR WARRANTY DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST
        LIGHTNING DAMAGE.
        <br/>&#186;       <b
        >Caregiver Role.</b>  It
        is highly recommended that you have at least one family member, friend,
        neighbor, or professional configured as Caregiver for your account.  This allows Halo to contact someone you
        trust to be involved in the case you need assistance.   The Caregiver is not a substitute for emergency
        service.  Halo will contact Emergency
        Personnel in the event Halo is unable to reach the User or a Caregiver.
