Story:  Plugging in the battery

	As a device
	I want to issue a battery plugged command
	So that the healthserver displays the batter plugged icon

	Scenario:  Plug in the battery

		Given a 'device id', 'user id', 'battery percentage', 'time remaining', and a 'gateway id'
		When I issue a 'battery plugged command'
		Then the user should verify 'battery plugged icon'
		
	Scenario:  Plug in the battery for device 2 registered to user 2
	
		Given a '2', '2', '50', '550', and a '2'
		When I issue a 'battery plugged command'
		Then the user should verify 'battery plugged icon'
