Equipment. The Health Data shall also mean any information provided by the Subscriber or User to Halo using the User Intake Form<br />
or through the Internet Portal.<br />
<strong>1.7</strong> <u>Internet Portal.</u> Internet Portal shall mean the password-protected Internet website that the Subscriber may access to update<br />

Subscriber shall update Halo in writing of any changes in phone numbers for themselves, the User, or the Caregiver(s), and any other<br />
changes if they cannot, or chose not to, use the Internet Portal for this purpose.<br />
<strong>1.8</strong> <u>Provider.</u> Provider shall refer to ___________________________________ (Halo Authorized Partner providing service).<br />
<br/>

<strong><u>2. SUBSCRIBER&rsquo;S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</u></strong><br />
<strong>2.1</strong> <u>Equipment Requirements. </u>The Subscriber will provide at Subscriber&rsquo;s sole expense suitable electric, broadband Internet,<br />
and/or telephone service to allow installation and operation of the Equipment. The Subscriber will pay all the charges for such<br />
services including taxes if applicable.<br />
<strong>2.2</strong><u>License Grant.</u> Subscriber hereby grants Halo a license to access and use the Health Data in connection with the services<br />
provided by Halo. The Subscriber also grants Halo the right to access, utilize, create and publish derivative works from any and all<br />
Health Data. The derivative works may use Health Data for creating statistics of a larger population. When doing so, Halo does not<br />
include any personal identifying information; nor will the Provider be identified. For example, Halo might publish fall statistics or the<br />
number of hours the Equipment is worn during sleep for the entire User population.<br />
<strong>2.3</strong> <u>Authorization.</u> The Subscriber hereby authorizes Halo to share the Health Data, only with entities and individuals for the<br />
purpose of providing medical care and for the purpose of sharing information with others selected by the Subscriber. The Subscriber<br />
agrees that this authorization permits the disclosure of health or treatment information to Caregivers and Emergency Personnel that<br />
may also contain sensitive health information.<br />
This authorization will remain in effect and permit the ongoing disclosure by Halo of the Health Data until the Subscriber deletes the<br />
User&rsquo;s profile in the Internet Portal entirely or revokes the authorization by notifying Halo in writing. The Subscriber agrees that any<br />
revocation will not apply to actions Halo has already taken in reliance on prior authorization.<br />
<strong>2.4</strong><u> User Intake Form.</u> The Subscriber shall use the User Intake Form to designate the identity of the User&rsquo;s Caregivers and place<br />
any limitations on the use of Health Data. The Subscriber is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information<br />
provided to Halo using the User Intake Form. If the Internet Portal is used to subsequently update the information supplied on the<br />
User Intake Form, the Subscriber is responsible for the security of his or her passwords and for any use of the Subscriber&rsquo;s account.<br />
The Subscriber is at least 18 years of age. The Subscriber&rsquo;s use of the Internet Portal and Equipment shall comply with all applicable<br />
laws, regulations, and ordinances, including any laws relating to the export of data or software. The Subscriber shall not disrupt the<br />
proper operation of the Equipment or the Internet Portal.<br />
<strong>2.5</strong> <u>HIPAA. </u>The Subscriber shall only transmit, create or display health or other information that the Subscriber is authorized to<br />
use, transmit, create or display. The Subscriber acknowledges that Halo is not a &ldquo;covered entity&rdquo; under the Health Insurance<br />
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations promulgated thereunder (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;). As a result, HIPAA does not<br />
apply to the transmission of Health Data by Halo to any third party.<br />
<strong>2.6</strong> <u>Telephone provider.</u> The Subscriber acknowledges that if the User&rsquo;s telephone line is occupied, the Equipment will not be<br />
able to obtain access to the phone line unless the User has his or her telephone provider install a RJ31X jack. If the User has such jack<br />
installed, the Subscriber consents to an interrupt of the User&rsquo;s telephone in the event the Equipment detects an emergency or lifethreatening<br />
situation.<br />

<strong>2.7</strong><u> Report.</u> The Subscriber shall report to Provider, as soon as practical, any perceived defect in the Equipment or Internet<br />
Portal. The Subscriber shall provide to Halo an evaluation of the Equipment, Internet Portal, and services provided by Halo upon<br />
Halo&rsquo;s reasonable request.<br />
<strong>2.8</strong> <u>Use of Panic Button.</u> The Subscriber agrees that the Equipment&rsquo;s panic button should be used only in the event of an<br />
emergency. The Subscriber acknowledges that Caregivers and Emergency Personnel will be notified, even if the panic button was<br />
activated accidentally or in error.<br />
<br/>

<strong><u>3. HALO&rsquo;S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</u></strong><br />
<strong>3.1</strong> <u>Relay of Health Data.</u> Halo shall use its reasonable best efforts to contact Emergency Personnel and Caregivers in the event<br />
the Equipment detects an emergency situation or receives notice that the Equipment&rsquo;s panic button has been activated. Halo will<br />
transmit pertinent Health Data to the Caregivers and Emergency Personnel, in accordance with the account settings in the User&rsquo;s<br />
Health Data file as established by the Subscriber or User.<br /><br/>

    <strong><u>4. PRIVACY POLICY</u></strong><br />
    <strong>4.1</strong> The Subscriber acknowledges that only the Subscriber and User have access to the Health Data. The Subscriber or User are<br />
    the only individuals who can view and edit the information supplied in the Intake Form or over Internet Portal; and the information<br />
    will only be shared with others as described in Section 2.0 and section 4.2 below. The Subscriber, User and Caregiver can add or<br />
    delete a Caregiver for the User&rsquo;s records.<br />
    <strong>4.2 </strong>From time to time, Halo may aggregate data to publish trend statistics and associations. Halo may make health information<br />
    available for research purposes or to better refine the algorithms and services provided through Halo. All health information will be<br />
    de-identified and no data can be used to personally identify any User.<br />
    <strong>4.3</strong> Halo&rsquo;s servers automatically record log information about Subscriber or Users use of the Internet portal (such as number of<br />
    sign-ins and number of times a link was clicked). The log information will be used to operate and improve the service.<br />
    <strong>4.4</strong> Halo adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our<br />

    <strong>7.2</strong> <u>Power/Phone Failure.</u> Halo is not responsible for the failure of the User&rsquo;s telephone, internet or power services. In the event<br />

    for any and all claims and lawsuits including the payment of all damages, expenses, costs and attorney&rsquo;s fees whether these claims be<br />
    based upon alleged intentional conduct, active or passive negligence, or strict or product liability, on the part of the Provider, its agent,<br />
    servants or employees. The Subscriber shall and does hereby indemnify and save Provider/Halo, its distributors and agents harmless<br />
    from any and all liability resulting from the selection, possession, operation, control, use and maintenance of the Equipment. In the<br />

    agent fees, or court costs resulting from such litigation.<br />
    <strong>7.4</strong> <u>Hold Harmless.</u> Subscriber hereby releases, discharges and agrees to hold Provider/Halo harmless from any and all claims,<br />
    liabilities, damages, losses or expenses, arising from or caused by any hazard covered by insurance in or on the premises of User<br />

    ANY OF HALO'S LICENSORS MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE HALO<br />

Neither Halo, nor provider, nor any of Halo's licensors make any other warranty, expressed or<br />

<strong><u>Contact Information</u></strong><br />
You may contact Halo Monitoring online at <a href="http://www.halomonitoring.com">http://www.halomonitoring.com</a>, phone:<br />
1-888-971-HALO (4256), or email: support@halomonitoring.com.<br />

<h3 style="color:#999999">ADDENDUM II: TO HALO SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT</h3>
<strong>This form must be completed when the Subscriber Agreement is signed or at Installation if Halo or their representative do the<br />
installation for the User.</strong> By signing below I acknowledge the following:<br />
<ul>
<li><strong> Account Activation.</strong> After calling at 1-888-971-4256 and completing the installation process, it will take up to 24 hours<br/>
for critical events including falls and panic button presses to be monitored and responded to by the Call Center. Also, any<br/>
subsequent profile updates for the user and/or caregiver may also take up to 24 hours to update and change how and who the Call<br/>
Center contacts for critical events.</li>
<li><strong> Quick Start and User Guide.</strong> I have received and read the myHalo User Guide.</li>
<li> <strong>RJ31X Jack.</strong> If the User&rsquo;s standard telephone line is occupied, the Equipment will not be able to obtain access to the phone line<br />
unless the Subscriber has his or her telephone provider install a RJ31X jack. If the Subscriber has such jack installed, the<br />
Equipment will interrupt the User&rsquo;s telephone in the event it detects an emergency or life-threatening situation. This is necessary<br />
to ensure the Call Center receives notification of the event. Contact a professional phone line installer for further details. If you<br />
have a home alarm system connected to the phone line, the installer will need to coordinate with the alarm system company to<br />
ensure that your home alarm service is not disabled or disrupted.</li>
<li> <strong>Uninterruptible Power Supply.</strong> The Subscriber may wish to use an optional UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) in<br />
conjunction with the myHalo Equipment. Doing so will provide battery backup power for the myHalo Home Gateway during an<br />
AC power failure and can allow continued communication between the Home Gateway and the standard phone line during the<br />
power outage. Refer UPS to manufacturer&rsquo;s installation instructions.</li>
<li> <strong>Surge Protector.</strong> If the Subscriber elects not to use a UPS as described above, it is advised the Subscriber install a UL rated<br />
surge protector to protect both the power connection and any phone line connections to the Equipment. In the event of a power<br />
surge or line spike, the Equipment may be damaged and prevent its operation otherwise. YOUR WARRANTY DOES NOT<br />
PROTECT AGAINST LIGHTNING DAMAGE.</li>
<li> <strong>Caregiver Role.</strong> It is highly recommended that you have at least one family member, friend, neighbor, or professional<br />
configured as caregiver for your account. This allows Halo to contact someone you trust to be involved in the case you need<br />
assistance.</li>
</ul>
