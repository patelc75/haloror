This project was created for use by Halo Monitoring in support of their PERS application.
The project is partially derived from open source code based on licensing information contained in this file.
All copyrights and licenses from these derived componenets are contained in this file or in the original 
source if the core file is structurally the same (e.g. the SliderBox control is a new control developed 
from concepts by Brendan Meutzner, but structurally is different, therefore it is proper to give credit here
to his original application, Flex Finance, but not carry the same license in the new derived file.)

Certain portions of the componenet model are copyright from NearMe.Net for reuse in other projects, including:
* SliderBox
