# This is a Ruby script to create an ARB subscription using the ARB API.
# To run it you need Ruby 1.8.4, Builder 2.0.0 (Just type "gem install builder" to install the
# XML builder once you have Ruby).

# To test the sample just type "arbapisample.rb" The program just parses the XML response and
# prints a subscription ID if the create is successful or it displays an error code and error
# message.
